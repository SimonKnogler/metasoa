## Invitation to Participate

You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether to participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please ask if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.

## What is the Purpose of This Study?

This study investigates how people detect whether they are in control of moving objects on a screen. We are interested in understanding:

- How accurately people can identify which objects respond to their actions
- How confident people feel about their judgments of control

This research contributes to our understanding of human perception and motor control, with potential applications in human-computer interaction and clinical assessment.

## Why Have I Been Invited?

You have been invited because you are:

- Aged 18 years or older
- Have normal or corrected-to-normal vision
- Are able to use a computer mouse with your dominant hand
- Have no history of neurological conditions affecting motor control

---

## Do I Have to Take Part?

Participation is entirely voluntary. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to participate, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You are free to withdraw at any time during the study without giving a reason. Withdrawing will not affect you in any way.

## What Will Happen If I Take Part?

If you agree to participate, you will complete a computer-based task that takes approximately **90 minutes**. Here is what the study involves:

### The Task

1. You will see two shapes (a square and a circle) moving on the computer screen
2. You will move your computer mouse, and one of the shapes will respond to your movements while the other moves independently
3. Your task is to identify which shape you are controlling by pressing a key:
4. You should respond as quickly and accurately as possible

### Study Phases

The experiment consists of 5 different phases. You will receive regular breaks throughout the experiment (approximately every 100 trials).

---

## What Are the Possible Risks or Disadvantages?

This study involves minimal risk:

- **Fatigue**: The task requires concentration for 90 minutes. Regular breaks are provided to minimize fatigue.
- **Eye Strain**: Continuous screen viewing may cause mild eye strain. You may take additional breaks if needed.
- **Boredom**: The repetitive nature of the task may become tedious. Remember, you can withdraw at any time.

There are no known physical or psychological risks associated with this task beyond those experienced in everyday computer use.

## What Are the Possible Benefits?

While there may be no direct benefit to you from participating, your contribution will help advance our understanding of human perception and the sense of control. You may also find it interesting to learn about psychological research methods.
