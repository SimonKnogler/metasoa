## Study Title
**Control Detection Task: Investigating the Sense of Agency in Perceptual-Motor Tasks**

## Thank You

Thank you for participating in this study. Your contribution is valuable to our research on human perception and the sense of agency.

## What Was This Study About?

This study investigated the **sense of agency**—the feeling that you are in control of your own actions and their effects in the world. Specifically, we examined how people detect and judge whether they are controlling external objects (like shapes on a screen).

### The Main Research Questions

1. **How accurately can people detect control?**  
   We measured how well you could identify which of two moving shapes responded to your mouse movements.

2. **How do expectations influence agency judgments?**  
   We investigated whether learned expectations about task difficulty affect your sense of control and confidence.

3. **What is the relationship between control detection and subjective ratings?**  
   We examined how your objective performance (accuracy) relates to your subjective feelings of confidence and agency.

## What Happened During the Experiment?

### The Control Detection Task

On each trial, you saw two shapes (a square and a circle) moving on the screen. One shape (the **target**) was partially controlled by your mouse movements, while the other (the **distractor**) moved independently based on pre-recorded movement patterns.

The difficulty of detecting control was manipulated by varying the **proportion** of your mouse input that influenced the target's movement:
- **Higher proportion** = Easier to detect (more of your movement was reflected)
- **Lower proportion** = Harder to detect (more noise mixed in)

### The Three Phases

1. **Calibration Phase**  
   The black cue trials at the beginning were used to calibrate the task to your individual ability. We used an adaptive algorithm (QUEST+) to find difficulty levels that would produce specific accuracy rates for you personally.

2. **Learning Phase**  
   During this phase, colored cues (e.g., blue/green or red/yellow) were paired with different difficulty levels:
   - One color predicted **easier** trials (higher control proportion)
   - Another color predicted **harder** trials (lower control proportion)
   
   This phase was designed to help you learn these associations through experience and feedback.

3. **Test Phase**  
   In this phase, you encountered trials with the same colored cues but at a **medium** difficulty level that was the same for both cue colors. We also included some trials at the original learning levels to maintain the learned associations.
   
   **Key manipulation**: Although the cues predicted different difficulty levels based on your learning, many test trials were actually at the same objective difficulty. This allowed us to examine whether your expectations (based on the cue color) influenced your confidence and agency ratings independently of actual task difficulty.

### What We Measured

- **Accuracy**: Whether you correctly identified the controlled shape
- **Reaction Time**: How quickly you made your decision
- **Confidence Ratings** (1-4): How sure you were about your choice
- **Agency Ratings** (1-7): How much control you felt you had
- **Mouse Movement Data**: Detailed kinematics for understanding your detection strategy

## Was There Any Deception?

**No deception was used in this study.** 

The colored cues genuinely predicted different difficulty levels during the learning phase. During the test phase, we included trials at both the learned difficulty levels and at a medium level, but at no point did we provide you with false information. The cues always appeared as described, and your task (identifying the controlled shape) remained consistent throughout.

## Why Is This Research Important?

Understanding the sense of agency has implications for:

- **Clinical Applications**: Altered sense of agency is observed in conditions such as schizophrenia, functional movement disorders, and alien hand syndrome
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Designing interfaces where users feel in control of their actions
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Understanding how humans attribute agency may inform the development of AI systems
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Addressing fundamental questions about consciousness and free will
